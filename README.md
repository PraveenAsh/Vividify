The website looks forward to achieve image search through tags given by the user's. This is **GOOGLE's IMAGE LABELLER** in a re-invented form with interactive game mode UI. Although the website is self-explanatory, some details to set up the tools are briefed.

**Pre-requisites for setup:**

>1. Download the WEB_tech.sql file from the folder and set the MySQL functionality [Exclusively Xampp v.3.2.2 and above] and set up your server.
>2. Check if all images are present for your requirement.
>3. Check if the server connection is established by doing stub tests and clear your database for using the tool. 

**PROJECT:**

>- The project is designed for tagging images specific tags for search purpose.
>- This can be used as image-preprocessing tool for generating dataset for Machine Learning and Deep Learning problems.(like CIFAR10 dataset).
>- Project has a GAME stimulated UI for encouraging participation
>- vividify_dsx is a minigame based on a variation of **edit distance** where on providing a start word and end word the player has to type in all the valid intermediate words such that each of those words is a valid English word and it differs from the previous word by either substitution, deletion or insertion of a letter.(Implemented as a graph where shortest path is determined by BFS algorithm.)
